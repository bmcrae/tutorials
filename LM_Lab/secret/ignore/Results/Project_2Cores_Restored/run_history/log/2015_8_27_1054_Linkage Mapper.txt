Parameters:	['C:\\Dropbox\\LM_Lab_2015\\Secret\\LinkageMapper1_0_9\\toolbox\\scripts\\lm_master.py', 'C:\\Dropbox\\LM_Lab_2015\\Secret\\Results\\Project_2Cores_Restored', '2_Core_Areas', 'Core_ID', 'Resistance_Post_Restoration', 'true', 'true', 'Cost-Weighted & Euclidean', '#', 'true', 'true', 'false', '4', 'Cost-Weighted', 'true', 'true', '#', '#', '#'] 

********************************************************
Note: ArcGIS errors are more likely when writing to remote drives or deep file structures. We recommend shallow project directories on local drives, like C:\puma. Errors may also result from conflicts with anti-virus software (known problems with AVG). We have also seen conflicts when writing to synchronized folders like Dropbox.
