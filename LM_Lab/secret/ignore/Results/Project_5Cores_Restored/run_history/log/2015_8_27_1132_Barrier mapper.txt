Linkage Mapper log file: Barrier mapper 

Start time:	Thu Aug 27 11:32:36 2015 
Parameters:	['C:\\Dropbox\\LM_Lab_2015\\Secret\\LinkageMapper1_0_9\\toolbox\\Scripts\\barrier_master.py', 'C:\\Dropbox\\LM_Lab_2015\\Secret\\Results\\Project_5Cores_Restored', 'Resistance_Post_Restoration', '1000', '1000', '0', 'Maximum', 'true', '#'] 

********************************************************
Note: ArcGIS errors are more likely when writing to remote drives or deep file structures. We recommend shallow project directories on local drives, like C:\puma. Errors may also result from conflicts with anti-virus software (known problems with AVG). We have also seen conflicts when writing to synchronized folders like Dropbox.

Running script s6_Barriers.py

Looking for C:\Dropbox\LM_Lab_2015\Secret\Results\Project_5Cores_Restored\datapass\linkTable_s5_plus.csv
There are 6 links in the table.
This includes 6 potential corridor links.
