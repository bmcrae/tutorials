Note: ArcGIS errors are more likely when writing to remote drives or deep file structures. We recommend shallow project directories on local drives, like C:\puma. Errors may also result from conflicts with anti-virus software (known problems with AVG). We have also seen conflicts when writing to synchronized folders like Dropbox.
