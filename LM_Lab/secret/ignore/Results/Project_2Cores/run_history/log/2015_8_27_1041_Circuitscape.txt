Note: ArcGIS errors are more likely when writing to remote drives or deep file structures. We recommend shallow project directories on local drives, like C:\puma. Errors may also result from conflicts with anti-virus software (known problems with AVG). We have also seen conflicts when writing to synchronized folders like Dropbox.
 
Setting data frame spatial reference to that of core area feature class.

Making local copy of resistance raster.

If you try to cancel your run and the Arc dialog hangs, 
you can kill Circuitscape by opening Windows Task Manager
and ending the cs_run.exe process.
